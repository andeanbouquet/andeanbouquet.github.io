# Procedures for new customers.

For Andean Bouquet, it is very important to establish a long lasting commercial relationship with our customers; the basis of which is getting to know more about our potential customers through their credit references.

If you are interested in becoming Andean Bouquet's customer, we, therefore, ask you to please find and download our credit application by clicking on the following link:
1. [Credit Application](../assets/pdfs/AndeanBouquet-CA.pdf)
2. Once the application is filled out, email it to: malvarez@andeanbouquet.com

Please note:
- All new customers must prepay the first 5 shipments. After this requirement is met and your credit application is accepted, we proceed to open a credit account that corresponds to your monthly orders.
- All prepayments must be done one day before shipment.

**Thank you for your interest in our products and welcome to Andean Bouquet's Family!**
