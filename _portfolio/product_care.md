# Cut Hydrangea Care
1. Take off plastic sleeve.
2. Cut stems at a 45 degree angle under water in a bucket.
3. Leave them hydrating for 5 minutes.
4. Place flowers in a clean vase.
5. Mist petals with a spray with clean water every other day to avoid dehydration.
6. Make sure the vase always has water above cut stem level.
7. Change vase water and re-cut stems every 3 days.
8. If any flower wilts, completely submerge the flower head in water and place it in the vase again. It will revive!
9. Keep flowers out of direct sunlight and away from heat and drafts.

# About Antique Hydrangeas

The Antique Hydrangeas endure a long time in the crop. These flowers are exposed to different weather conditions and aging of the flower for a longer time than other hydrangeas, this is why they may show pink spots, different range of colors such as light green, dark green, and, sometimes, brown spots. Please do not mind these variations, they are part of the antique aging process of the flowers, and this is what makes them so unique and special.

# About Bird-of-Paradise
Bird-of-Paradise is a special kind of flower, it has up to 3 consecutive blooms. When the first bloom has worn out, do not be afraid to tear it off; behind comes the other! It is a magical flower which will make your arrangements last longer than most other flowers.

Note, if the petals do not show for one or two days, try to open the natural overture on the top of the flower and slightly pull the orange petal just a little, to help it bloom.

# Ornithogalum or Star-of-Bethlehem

Please note that this flower is thirsty from its travel, just hydrate it and it will begin to blossom after a few hours and over a day or two.
