We always work on improving our product's quality, therefore, your feedback is very important for us.

####  Flower quality problems:

In case of any quality problem related to our flowers, please send your report down all the logistics chain (agency, broker, truck company) and to us to our e-mails:
- Hebert Varela: hebert.varela@andeanbouquet.com
- María Álvarez: malvarez@andeanbouquet.com

This report **must** be sent no more than 2 days after customers receive the product and shall be accompanied by pictures of the damaged flower boxes with AWB label on them and a note with the amount of stems affected.

After all the information is sent, we will contact all related parties to determine responsabilities.

####  Fumigation:

#### PHYTOSANITARY VALIDATION


- The broker initially receives an **emergency action notification** from PPQ, which means a temporary hold of the flower until specialists make a final identification of the organism found to determine if it requires a quarantine action (destruction, fumigation or re-exportation).
- This notification is **not** enough to take an action.
The only authority to order an action resides with the specialists. If the broker orders a fumigation before being certain that it is mandatory, the flower could be unnecessarily fumigated.
- You, the customer, have to ask your broker for the PPQ form which must have:
1. Scientific name (Latin name) of the quarantine intercepted organism. This information can be obtained by the broker by calling to CBP (pest identification).
2. A seal saying “Treated and released” with date, time, name and ID of the specialist who treated the flower.

In case of a shipment hold by PPQ, we will **only** be responsible for the fumigation payment if all PPQ documents are sent with the signature of the USDA entomologist certifying that the fumigation was done due to a quarantine plague.
Please note: No fumigation invoices will be assumed by us if the broker orders to fumigate just for a fast release of the flower with no documentary support.
