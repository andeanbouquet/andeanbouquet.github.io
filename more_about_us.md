####  Andean Bouquet’s history

Andean Bouquet’s history Andean Bouquet was founded in 2001 by Hebert Varela, owner and manager, and a group of interdisciplinary professionals specialized in production, logistics, marketing and administration, gathering almost 14 years experience in the cut flower industry. Today, Andean Bouquet has become a well established and solid company focused mostly on growing and exporting cut hydrangeas.

Our team’s knowledge of the flower industry and Colombia’s exceptional conditions for flower growing, such as high mountain climates and almost non-changing number of light hours/day and temperatures all year long, which make our country a unique place to grow flowers efficiently, has made our company a leader in the cut hydrangea flower business.

At Andean Bouquet, we have been working to build long lasting and strong commercial relationships with our customers because we believe in mutual benefit and because we know that together we can better find new ways to make people happy with nature’s beautiful gift: flowers!
