<p>Andean Bouquet’s history Andean Bouquet was founded in 2001 by Hebert Varela, owner and manager, and a group of interdisciplinary professionals specialized in production, logistics, marketing and administration, gathering almost 14 years experience in the cut flower industry. Today, Andean Bouquet has become a well established and solid company focused mostly on growing and exporting cut hydrangeas.</p>

<p>Our team’s knowledge of the flower industry and Colombia’s exceptional conditions for flower growing, such as high mountain climates and almost non-changing number of light hours/day and temperatures all year long, which make our country a unique place to grow flowers efficiently, has made our company a leader in the cut hydrangea flower business.</p>
