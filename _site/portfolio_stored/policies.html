<h1 id="flower-quality-problems">Flower quality problems:</h1>

<p>In case of any quality problem related to our flowers, please send your report down all the logistics chain (agency, broker, truck company) and to us to our e-mails:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hebert Varela: hebert.varela@andeanbouquet.com</li>
  <li>María Álvarez: malvarez@andeanbouquet.com</li>
</ul>

<p>This report <strong>must</strong> be sent no more than 2 days after customers receive the product and shall be accompanied by pictures of the damaged flower boxes with AWB label on them and a note with the amount of stems affected.</p>

<p>After all the information is sent, we will contact all related parties to determine responsabilities.</p>

<h1 id="fumigation">Fumigation:</h1>

<h3 id="phytosanitary-validation">PHYTOSANITARY VALIDATION</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The broker initially receives an <strong>emergency action notification</strong> from PPQ, which means a temporary hold of the flower until specialists make a final identification of the organism found to determine if it requires a quarantine action (destruction, fumigation or re-exportation).</li>
  <li>This notification is <strong>not</strong> enough to take an action.
The only authority to order an action resides with the specialists. If the broker orders a fumigation before being certain that it is mandatory, the flower could be unnecessarily fumigated.</li>
  <li>You, the customer, have to ask your broker for the PPQ form which must have:
    <ol>
      <li>Scientific name (Latin name) of the quarantine intercepted organism. This information can be obtained by the broker by calling to CBP (pest identification).</li>
      <li>A seal saying “Treated and released” with date, time, name and ID of the specialist who treated the flower.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In case of a shipment hold by PPQ, we will <strong>only</strong> be responsible for the fumigation payment if all PPQ documents are sent with the signature of the USDA entomologist certifying that the fumigation was done due to a quarantine plague.
Please note: No fumigation invoices will be assumed by us if the broker orders to fumigate just for a fast release of the flower with no documentary support.</p>
